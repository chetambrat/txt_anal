 WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell, Jr. (D-NJ-09) voted in favor of the Uyghur Human Rights Act (S.178), bipartisan legislation that calls for harsh sanctions on Chinese government officials for the Chinese Communist Party’s continued vicious subjugation and continuing internment of Muslim ethnic Uyghurs.

“China’s persecution of their Uyghur population is something out of the Dark Ages or Stalin’s Soviet Union,” said Rep. Pascrell, one of Congress’s foremost critic of the authoritarian Chinese government. “The Chinese Communist Party has built a modern gulag archipelago that is imprisoning millions of Uyghurs because of their religious beliefs. Uyghurs have been subject to mass surveillance and forced into labor camps. They deserve justice for the loathsome acts they have endured against their will. While the shameful silence of Donald Trump and Mike Pompeo has only emboldened the violence of this autocratic regime, our action speaks loudly against Chinese government officials for their monstrous brutalities. Congress will not stop shining a light on the Chinese Communist Party’s crimes against human dignity. From our top government officials to U.S. companies operating in China, we need to be united in our condemnation of the Chinese Communist Party’s merciless acts.”
